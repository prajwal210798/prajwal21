\begin_layout Abstract
This is the case where we would learn how to design a mobile inverted pendulum
 in matlab will talk about a lot of things which will be needed to understand
 the concept, together with that I will also provide the link of resource
 where you can study about these things these are for quick refrence simple
 guide which will lead us in making of our robot

\begin_layout Subsection*
Output Controllability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Output controllability generally means, that we can steer output of dynamical
 system independently of its state vector.
 A system is said to be completely output controllable if it is possible
 to construct an unconstrained control vector u(t) that will transfer any
 given initial output y at t
\begin_inset Formula $_{0}$
\end_inset

 to any final output y at t
\begin_inset Formula $_{1}$
\end_inset

 in a finite time interval t

 Dynamical system is output controllable if and only if rank oC = p

\begin_layout Subsection*
OBSERVABILITY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A system is said to be observable at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 if, with the system in state 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(t_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

, it is possible to determine this state from the observation of the output
 over a finite time interval.The system is said to be completely observable
 if every state xAt 0 B can be determined from the observation of y(t) over
 a finite time interval, t
\begin_inset Formula $_{0}$
\end_inset

 to t
\begin_inset Formula $_{1}$
\end_inset

 .
 The system is, therefor, completely observable if every transition of the
 state eventually affects every ele- ment of the output vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $X(t)$

 is known as Controllability Gramian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This measure has physical meaning of minimum input energy to change the
 states.
 However, it is hard to use this method for unstable systems because the
 steady-state value of Gramian cannot be defined.

rank of this matrix should be n in our case it should be 4

\begin_layout Part*
Observability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
obsv(A,C) will give the observability matrix for the system and for the
 specific combination of output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
rank of this matrix tell us that if the system is observable or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this we see that if measure the position of the cart then we can observe
 or say estimate the other states from this this output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But in the other case if we try to estimate other states from pendulum position
 then it is not possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reason:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon seeing the observable matrix we see that first column of the matrix
 is zero the reason is that state position is independent from other states
 it does not depend on the states .
 So other states does not give any information of this particular state
 ,So we need to always find the postion state from sensor .

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets take another case in this case we dont want to control the position
 of the cart , It is free to move around the room but we do need to control
 the other states viz [speed, tilt angle of pendulum, angular rate of falling
 of pendulum]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general case we may want to have speed=0;tilt angle=180; angular rate=0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
lets see the observability and controllability in this case
\end_layout

Here order of the system is 3

Here we see that system is both observable and controllable both.

CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN IN STATE SPACE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
One the the thing that I like about the working in State space is that we
 work directly in time domain.
 We can easily interpret that the output of the system with respect to time
 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Here I touch upon the various Basic Ideas that how can we control the closed
 system varoious method will be discussed in this section.

\begin_layout Part*
POLE PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that all state variables are 
\emph on
measurable
\emph default
 and are available for feedback.
 It can be shown that if the system considered is completely state controllable,
 then 
\series bold
poles of the closed-loop system
\series default
 may be placed at any desired locations by means of state feedback through
 an appropriate state feedback gain matrix.

\begin_layout Standard
One may ask that how do we determined the position of poles?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can estimate or can approximate the

dominant desired poles
\series default
 from the 
\series bold
root locus

 .Other roots can act as a non dominant poles.

In matlab we will use place command and to get the gain matrix k ,then we
 will see the eigen values of the modified sytem matrix viz A-B*k

\begin_layout Standard
one eigen values of the system matrix is at positive half of complex plane
 .
 So any input to the system will result in the un-stability in the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
here input to the system is the step input having magnitude of 0.02.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next I place the eigen values of the system randomly at left of complex
 plane without any performance criteria and then i have checked the system
 stability means either the system is stable or system converges to the
 values viz position at -0.06 and pedulum position at at -0.01.

Note that this development assumed that r was constant, but it could also
 be used where r is a slowly time-varying command.

 but it also lead the error in cart position near to zero.
